            <h3> Recenties</h3>
            <p> Metacritic ~ EvilPlatypus ~ 10/10 ~ have downloaded hundreds and hundreds of games on my phone and of all of them, there is only a small handful of games that I re-download on my new phones. The very first one I do is this game every time, because it is easily my favorite ever game. This is a very fun mix of bloons tower defense 5 and a clash of clans type game, mixed in one. If you like both of those game, I promise you will love this game.</p>
            <p> Metacritic ~ Karl_Maks ~ 9/10 ~ Despite not having a lot of experience with Bloons TD (as I only played the flash version and battles), this game had a lot of fun for me, as I love strategy and management. I have more fun from the "city-builder" aspect as I love to plan out districts and add asthetics. Very fun, only downside is the premium currency, but I haven't encountered any problems with it yet.</p>
            <p> Metacritic ~ legodinosandZT2 ~ 5/10 ~ After loving the bananas out of the original Bloons TD 5 and having a reasonably fun time with the subsequent Bloons TD Battles, I was ready to go ape over yet another entry into the Bloons series. Unfortunately, Bloons Monkey City is nowhere near the fun those two had to offer. Instead, the game takes the basic premise of the classic tower defense and wraps it in the guise of a Clash of Clans knockoff (shouldn't we really have a genre for that now?) To no one's surprise, the two don't gel together at all, and the result is a surprisingly tedious experience. Not a complete disaster, but a disappointing misfire.</p>
